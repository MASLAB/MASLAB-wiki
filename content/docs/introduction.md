## MASLAB Robot Kit
At the beginning of the class, each team will be provided a tote with parts, tools, and a small part organizer. There will also be other shared materials and components such as MDF boards and servos for your team to start building the robot. Each team can also request additional parts by filling out an online form. Please be mindful about shipping time and fee.

### Hardwares
MASLAB robot kit consists of two central components:  
1. A Raspberry Pi 5 computer - A powerful mini computer to run computer vision and control your robot

2. Raven - MASLAB custom circuit board to handle power and interaction with actuators and sensors

MASLAB KitBot also includes motors with encoders and servos to mobilize the robot. Teams can opt to use other motors and servos. More about actuators will be covered in another guide.

Raven also includes 2 qwiic (https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) connector to connect the Pi 5 to other sensors. More about how to use sensors will be covered in another guide. 

To power these devices LiPo batteries will be provided.
> [!CAUTION]
> LiPo batteries are **DANGEROUS**. A tutorial about using LiPo battery will be provided during the first week of class. Do not use the battery until then. In addition, please review [battery guide](5-Battery) before using the robot with a battery. 

### Softwares
The Raspberry Pi 5 is already set up with Raspberry Pi OS Trixie. Communication with the Pi will be through the Pi's wireless hotspot or WiFi. More details will be provided in [Raspberry Pi guide].
