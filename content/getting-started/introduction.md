# Introduction

Your task is to utilise the knowledge and tools at your disposal to **design**, **construct**, and **test** a robot. In the **final week** of this class, your robot is expected to accomplish the goal(s) described in the **[competition rules](../rules)** document. 

Each team is provided a **MASLAB robot box** containing tools and components utilised in this class. In addition to the **robot box** provided, an allocation of **shared materials** such as **MDF** and **electronic servos** are available for use. In the likely event your team desires equipment not *immediately available*, an [external component order form](https://tinyurl.com/maslab-order) is available for use.

## MASLAB Robot Box Contents
There are **two central components** to your **robot box**; the first of which is a **[Raspberry Pi](../raspberry-pi)**.

The second of which is the **Raven Board**, a MASLAB custom power electronics board designed to interact with actuators and sensors.

The **robot box** also includes motors with encoders and servos to mobilize the robot. While provided, teams are not required to use these motors and can opt to use other means. The **Raven Board** includes two **[qwiic connectors](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic)** to connect the **Raspberry Pi** to external sensors. To power these devices, **LiPo batteries** will be provided.

> [!CAUTION]
> LiPo batteries are **DANGEROUS**. A tutorial about using LiPo battery will be provided during the first week of class. Do not use the battery until then. In addition, please review **[battery guide](../../electronics/battery)** before using the robot with a battery. 

## Component Checklist
Before leaving this section, verify the following items are present in your **robot box**. Please ask the staff if you are unsure which component is which.
